  # Node Classification with Graph Neural Networks (GCN, GraphSAGE, GAT)

Reproducible PyTorch Geometric implementations of three foundational Graph Neural Network models applied to **node classification** on citation networks (**Cora**, **Citeseer**).

This repo is part of my PhD preparation journey in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).

---

## 🚀 Features
- Implementations of **GCN**, **GraphSAGE**, and **GAT**
- Training on **Cora** and **Citeseer** datasets
- Easy model selection with CLI flag (`--model gcn|sage|gat`)
- Logs training/validation/test accuracy
- Saves loss/accuracy curves to PNG
- Includes a **2-page report** analyzing results

## ▶️ Usage

Train a model with one command:
```
# Train GCN on Cora
python run_gnn.py --model gcn --dataset Cora

# Train GraphSAGE on Citeseer
python run_gnn.py --model sage --dataset Citeseer

# Train GAT on Cora
python run_gnn.py --model gat --dataset Cora
```
Options:
-	`--model`: `gcn`, `sage`, or `gat`
-	`--dataset`: `Cora` or `Citeseer`
-	`--epochs`: number of training epochs (default: 200)
